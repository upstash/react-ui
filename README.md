## Development

This monorepo is managed by turborepo and uses `pnpm` for dependency management.

#### Install dependencies

```bash
pnpm install
```

#### Build

```bash
pnpm build
```

#### Run Test

Set the `NEXT_PUBLIC_UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN` environment
variables by creating a `.env` file under `examples/nextjs13`.

```bash
cd examples/nextjs
npx playwright install
pnpm test
```

## Release

1. Run `pnpm changeset`
   This will prompt you to select which packages have changed. It will also create a changeset file in the `.changeset` directory.
2. Run `pnpm changeset version`
   This will bump the versions of the packages previously specified with pnpm changeset (and any dependents of those) and update the changelog files.
3. Run `pnpm install`
   This will update the lockfile and rebuild packages.
4. Commit the changes
5. Run `pnpm publish -r`
   This command will publish all packages that have bumped versions not yet present in the registry.
